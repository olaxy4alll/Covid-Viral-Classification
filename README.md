*****Project Information*****

The aim of this project is to perform image classificaiton of COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonia. 

You will find attached my Presentation named "COVID_29Pneumonia_Image_Classification.pptx" in ppt format, and my project report "COVID_29Pneumonia_Image_Classification.pdf" in pdf format. I also attached my source code in a zip file named "COVID-19_Pneumonia_Image_Classification.zip". I then uploaded my datasets and test set. The test set contains 30 images each from the three classes in our data set and used it as our testing data. The code can be executed on Jupyter notebook by running each code cell and the training takes about 5 to 7mins. I have already set the path in the data loader code cell. Normally, it should work but incase of any path or location issues, you can kindly change the path to your current working directory on your computer in the preparing data loader code cell. I added some comment to the code in each cell explaining the code cell.

Should you have any question sir? or need me to provide anything. Please do not hesitate to let me know and i will glady do it.
